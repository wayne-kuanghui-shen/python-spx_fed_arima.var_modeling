# *Forecasting US Equity Market: Exploring the Role of Fed Monetary Policy*

**‚úèÔ∏è Introduction**: The FOMC meeting is one of the high-profile events for stock investors. The study aims to utilitize different approaches to capture the effect of Federal Reserve monetary policy meetings on US equity market using time series models.

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Objectives 
- Apply web scraping for Fed meeting-related data
- Derive the Fed fund rate data into potentially useful forms such as a dummy variable of whether there was a meeting during that month and a categorical variable of the change(increase/unchange/decrease) of interest rate.
- Input the Fed fund rate data as exogenous and endogenous variables in ARIMA model and VAR model, respectively

## üìç Conclusions
- Fed meeting-related data is not useful in explaining equity prices, either included as endogenous or exogenous variables
- Correlation test, variance decomposition and granger causality test all support this result
- But no significant result could suggest that asset managers might not want to use Fed meeting related data to predict equity prices
